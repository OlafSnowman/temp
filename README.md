Start at rscript.R, which is where I am testing right now. 

get_profile_more_enhanced.R checks if there is a button or not (more than 20 coauthors or not), and from there either scrape_with_button or scrape_without_button is called

format of dataframe is (coauth_gsid, coauth_name, coauth_institution)
